# Data Structures Course Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments in the Data Structures course on Coursera. The solutions have been marked as correct by the checkers provided by the course.

## Course Overview

The Data Structures course is part of the "Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization" provided by UCSD on Coursera. It covers a range of topics, including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, disjoint sets, trees, heaps, and hash tables.

## Compiler Flags

To compile the C++ program with the required flags, use the following command:

```shell
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++14 <filename> -lm
```
